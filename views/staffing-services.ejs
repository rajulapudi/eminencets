            Technology Staffing is the core recruiting division of ETS. We work with companies in a wide array of
            verticals, including retail services, financial services, professional services, insurance services and
            healthcare industries. We are structured to serve clients on a national level and are able to place
            professionals in all US regions. <br>
          </p>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li id="contract-hiring"> <strong>CONTRACT HIRING</strong>
              <p>Our approach provides your business with dedicated staffing consultants. The result is increased
                responsiveness, as well as accountability, because the consultant who creates your staffing solution is
                also responsible for implementing it. Highly trained and qualified, our recruiters are experts in
                screening talent and assessing proficiency. We also conduct focused behavioral interviews and
                comprehensive skill assessments to ensure you get the exact staffing solution you need. When ETS
                evaluates a company’s need for contract staffing, we explore the potential for a healthy, productive
                relationship based on your corporate values.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="semipermanent-hiring"> <strong>CONTRACT TO PERMANENT HIRING</strong>
              <p>ETS gives the client a great hiring advantage, the ability to evaluate a potential candidate on the job
                before making a commitment. This kind of hands-on assessment leads to more informed hiring decisions.
                Hiring the wrong person can wreak havoc on an organization - so it's always safer to "try before you
                buy." Moreover, sometimes you have a technical contingent worker who fits perfectly into your
                organization. Should you and the contingent worker placed by ETS decide you'd like to change the nature
                of the relationship to full time employment, ETS is happy to accommodate. Contract-to-hire staffing
                helps your business by acting as a bridge to full-time employment. Through our contract-to-hire program,
                you have the opportunity to evaluate a selected candidate in your business environment before making a
                hiring decision.</p>
            </li>
            <li id="permanent-hiring"> <strong>PERMANENT HIRING</strong>
              <p>At ETS, we believe that skilled, motivated and intelligent employees are the foundation upon which the
                most successful organizations are built. So hiring permanent employees and absorbing them into your
                organization is a serious commitment, so you need to make sure that you’re making this commitment to the
                right people. <br> By gaining an in-depth understanding of your company or career goals, our experienced
                IT recruiters are able to determine the best fit for your organization. <br> Our permanent staffing
                solutions give you access to fully screened and qualified candidates in any vertical of your choice.
                Leave staffing problems to us, so you can focus your energy and attention on what really matters - your
                core business. You can rely on our professional recruiters to find the perfect employees for you to
                either increase staff strength for new projects, or to replenish your employee numbers. At ETS, we are
                dedicated to creating the perfect employment matches for our clients. With us as your permanent staffing
                solutions provider, you can be rest assured that you will get the most suitable employees who are ready
                to work hard and stay loyal to you.</p>
