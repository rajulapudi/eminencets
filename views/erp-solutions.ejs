            <h4>What is ERP</h4>
            <p>
              Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a type of software suite of
              integrated applications for managing, automating and integrating
              day-to-day business processes of a company / Industry. It helps
              business leaders streamline company activities by connecting all
              data points and providing accurate business insights.
            </p>
            <h4>How ERP Works</h4>
            <p>
              In general, enterprise resource planning uses a centralized
              database for various business processes to reduce manual labor and
              to simplify existing business workflows. An ERP system typically
              contains dashboards where users can look at real-time data
              collected from all across the business to measure productivity and
              profitability.
            </p>
            <h4>Business Value</h4>

              ERP software has a lot to offer when it comes to business value.
              You can expect these benefits when using ERP software
